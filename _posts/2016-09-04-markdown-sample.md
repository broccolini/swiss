----------------

Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.
````
var foo = "bar";
````

Code can also use syntax highlighting.
````Javascript
var foo = "bar";
````

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```Javascript
var foo = "The same thing is true for code with syntax highlighting. A single line of code should horizontally scroll if it is really long.";
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

| Language    | Code               |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Javascript  | `var foo = "bar";` |
| Ruby        | `foo = "bar"`      |

----------------

Small images should be shown at their actual size.

![](http://placekitten.com/g/300/200/)

Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.

![](http://placekitten.com/g/1200/800/)

```
This is the final element on the page and there should be no margin below this.
```
